# Just Travel Front

![image-problem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/593da14a-af1f-4fb3-98d8-c5efe1cd9cd1)
1. I never used next before. When I tried to put my first image, it was blank... I tried to use next Image tag and img, but nothing went well.

2. My next move is to discard next and use vite and react with typescript: which is this project.

3. I could use MaterialUI or Bootstrap or Chackra UI as I used on [a previous project](https://github.com/twygo-trial/twygo-select-front) 
to create responsive components. But as **Just Travel** provided me the style cheet definitions, I choosed to go with your style in pure css.

## Description

This project is a web application developed using React and TypeScript. It includes a header component, a login button, a cart component with item count, and additional styling with custom fonts and responsive design.

## Features

- **Search for Tickets by City**: Displays the available tickets.
- **Add Tickets on Cart**: Add one more Ticket to buy.
